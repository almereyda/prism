		Our visualization shows examples of how Internet packets
		wander around the Internet cables while we use some of the most popular Internet services.
		Each country your data packets visit offers an opportunity for snooping.

		The cable routes on the map are taken from <a href="http://cablemap.info">cablemap.info</a>. We determined how
		packets are traveling through the Internet by using the program <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute">Traceroute</a>.
		It is using one of the basic Internet Protocols (IP): Asking every IP-router
		(think of it as a switchboard), which is forwarding a packet, about its identity.
		Not every router is answering to Traceroute and which cable is used, we don't know.
		Depending if it's day or night, the packets can take pretty different routes.

		In the end, the connections we are displaying in this app (in slow motion) are the most telling
		examples we have choosen from many different real requests to the particular
		service. Note: The locations that were determined on the basis of the router IP-Addresses do not necessarily
		correspond with the actual physical locations but rather â€“ where applicable - with the headquarters of their operators.
